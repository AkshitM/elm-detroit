### Elm Detroit Meetup Group
Our group is located in Southfield, MI and consists of people in the Metro Detroit area (and beyond) that are interested in the Elm programming language.

Our events are scheduled for the first Thursday of every month and are listed on our meetup page: [meetup.com/elm-detroit/](https://www.meetup.com/elm-detroit/). Attendees should RSVP.

Most of our events will be in the format of hack nights or coding nights but every so often, we'll plan on a presentation style talk or a workshop.


## Proposals

Talk proposals should be created as github issues in [this](https://github.com/Elm-Detroit/elm-detroit/issues) repo.

Proposals should:
* include a **title** and a **short description** of the talk
* be assigned to the proposed speaker
* tagged with the `proposal` label
* tagged with **one** of the following types: `project`, `talk` or `workshop` label
* mention the expected length
* specify an indication of when they will be ready by. If no indication of when they are for is provided they may be scheduled for the next meeting.

Please vote for proposals by starring/favouriting them.
